4. What do you understand by Serialization and Deserialization? Explain their purpose with an example.


please write your response here ...

serialization - the data is present idd we try to convert this data into a format like FHIR so that we can transefer and store in  aparticular form.
python object to json format

example - 

dumps and dump we use for this things

import json

patient = {
    "resourceType": "Patient",
    "id": "P001",
    "name": [
        {
            "use": "official",
            "family": "Sharath",
            "given": ["A", "L"]
        }
    ],
    "gender": "male"
}

patient_json = json.dumps(patient, indent=2)
print(patient_json)



Deserialization - it means that if we have a json format data we have to convert that to a python object again so for that purpose we use Deserialization 
json data to python object

example -
patient_obj = json.loads(patient_json)
print(patient_obj)
