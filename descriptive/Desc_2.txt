2. What do you understand by a "Bundle" in FHIR? 
When should it be used, what are the different types of Bundles available, and how do they differ from each other?

please put your response here ...

Bundle - Bundle is a group of different resource packaged into a single unit is called bundle.


The different types of bundle are 
1. batch - it will store each resoure in a bundle in a separete unit
2. collection - it will store all in one pack
3. transation - it will aslo store the data in separately but it is like atomic, complete or nothing
